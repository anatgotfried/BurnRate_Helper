## Introduction

This application helps you track and analyze your Training Peaks workouts by monitoring changes over time. Every time you refresh the data, the system compares the current state with the previous state and logs all changes, giving you complete visibility into your training plan evolution.

### Key Features
- **Automatic Change Detection**: Identifies additions, modifications, deletions, and movements
- **Complete History**: Maintains a full audit trail of all changes
- **Visual Interface**: Beautiful, intuitive UI for reviewing workouts and changes
- **JSON Storage**: Simple file-based storage for easy backup and portability

## Understanding iCal Format

### What is iCal?
iCal (iCalendar) is a standard format for exchanging calendar and scheduling information. Training Peaks exports your workouts in this format, which contains all the details about your training sessions.

### iCal URL Structure
Training Peaks provides a unique iCal URL for your calendar:
- **webcal://**: A URL scheme that indicates calendar data
- The system automatically converts this to **https://** for fetching
- Your URL contains a unique identifier (e.g., `FQ52PNFB5MWLS`)

### Important iCal Components
Each workout in the iCal file is represented as a **VEVENT** (calendar event) with these key properties:

- **UID**: Unique identifier that persists across modifications
- **SUMMARY**: Workout title/name
- **DESCRIPTION**: Detailed workout instructions
- **DTSTART**: Start date/time
- **DTEND**: End date/time
- **SEQUENCE**: Version number (increments with each modification)
- **STATUS**: Workout status (TENTATIVE, CONFIRMED, CANCELLED)
- **LAST-MODIFIED**: When the workout was last changed
- **LOCATION**: Where the workout takes place
- **CATEGORIES**: Workout type/category

## Interpreting the Change Log

### Change Log Structure

Each refresh creates a change log entry with:
- **Timestamp**: When the refresh occurred
- **Additions**: New workouts that appeared
- **Modifications**: Existing workouts that changed
- **Deletions**: Workouts that disappeared
- **Movements**: Workouts that moved to different times

### Reading Change Diffs

When a workout is modified, you'll see diffs like this:

```
summary:
- Morning Run
+ Morning Recovery Run

description:
- 45 min easy pace
+ 30 min very easy pace, focus on form
```

**How to read:**
- Lines with `-` (red, strikethrough): Old value
- Lines with `+` (green, bold): New value
- Field name tells you what changed

### Change Patterns to Watch

#### Pattern 1: Progressive Overload
Regular increases in volume or intensity across multiple workouts.

**Indicates:** Training plan progression

#### Pattern 2: Taper
Reductions in volume/intensity as race approaches.

**Indicates:** Race preparation

#### Pattern 3: Bulk Rescheduling
Many workouts moved by same time period.

**Indicates:** Schedule adjustment (travel, work conflict, etc.)

#### Pattern 4: Workout Type Swaps
Same time slots, different workout types.

## Daily Workflow Tips

### Best Practices for Daily Use

#### Morning Review (Recommended)
1. Open the application
2. Click "Refresh Workouts"
3. Review "Recent Changes" panel
4. Check today's workout details
5. Review next 2-3 days for upcoming changes

#### Weekly Planning Session
1. Refresh data
2. Review full change history for the week
3. Look at all upcoming workouts
4. Identify patterns or trends
5. Prepare questions for coach check-in

### When to Refresh

**High Priority Times:**
- Morning before training
- After coach communications
- Before weekly planning session
- After sync with Training Peaks mobile app

**Low Priority Times:**
- Multiple times per hour (unnecessary)
- Immediately after you upload workout data
- Late at night (unless you train early morning)

### Managing Change Fatigue

If you see constant changes:
1. **Identify patterns**: Is coach fine-tuning or is there confusion?
2. **Communicate**: Ask about planning philosophy
3. **Set expectations**: Understand how far ahead plan is firm
4. **Focus on key workouts**: Don't sweat minor adjustments to easy days

### Backup and History

The `data/workouts.json` file contains everything:
- **Backup regularly**: Copy this file to cloud storage
- **Version control**: Consider using git for the data folder
- **Pre-race backup**: Save a copy before major events
- **Season archive**: Keep copies at season boundaries

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: "Failed to fetch iCal"

**Possible causes:**
- Internet connection problem
- Training Peaks server temporarily down
- Invalid or expired iCal URL

**Solutions:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Try accessing URL in web browser
3. Log into Training Peaks and regenerate iCal URL
4. Wait a few minutes and try again

#### Issue 2: No Changes Detected (But You Know There Were Changes)

**Possible causes:**
- Changes haven't synced to iCal export yet
- Browser cached old data
- Refresh needed on Training Peaks side

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for Training Peaks to update export
2. Clear browser cache and refresh
3. Log into Training Peaks and force a save on the workout
4. Check if UID changed (rare, but indicates workout recreation)

#### Issue 3: Duplicate Workouts Appearing

**Possible causes:**
- Coach created new workout instead of modifying existing
- Workout copied to new date
- UID conflict (very rare)

**Solutions:**
1. Check UIDs - if different, these are truly separate workouts
2. Contact coach about duplicate
3. One workout might be deleted in next sync

#### Issue 4: Workout Shows as "Modified" but Looks Identical

**Possible causes:**
- Sequence number changed without visible changes
- Metadata or formatting changes
- Timezone adjustments
- Internal Training Peaks fields updated

**Solutions:**
- Check sequence numbers in metadata
- Compare timestamps carefully
- Generally safe to ignore if no substantive changes
- May indicate coach reviewed the workout

#### Issue 5: Historical Workouts Keep Changing

**Possible causes:**
- Coach adding notes or actual execution data
- Corrections to past workouts
- TSS (Training Stress Score) recalculations
- Athlete or coach adding completion notes

**Solutions:**
- Normal behavior - historical data can be updated
- Check description field for new notes
- Verify if execution data added after workout completion
- Consider this valuable additional context

#### Issue 6: App Shows Error After Refresh

**Possible causes:**
- Malformed iCal data
- Network timeout
- Server error
- Invalid characters in workout description

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for detailed error
2. Try refresh again (may be transient)
3. Test iCal URL in validator tool
4. Contact Training Peaks support if persistent

### Data Recovery

If you accidentally lose data:

1. **Check for backup**: Look for `workouts.json` backup files
2. **Git history**: If using version control, revert to previous commit
3. **Start fresh**: Delete JSON file and refresh - will rebuild from current iCal state
4. **History loss**: Old change logs can't be recovered, but current state will be accurate

### Performance Issues

If the app becomes slow:

1. **Large history**: Consider archiving old change log entries
2. **Many workouts**: Normal - iCal includes extensive history
3. **Browser memory**: Close and reopen browser
4. **JSON file size**: If over 10MB, consider splitting by year

## Advanced Tips

### Understanding Sequence Numbers

Sequence numbers are critical for tracking changes:
- Start at 0 for new workouts
- Increment by 1 for each modification
- Never decrease (unless workout recreated)
- Can skip numbers if edits made without saving

### Timezone Handling

The app handles timezones automatically:
- All times converted to ISO format with timezone
- Display uses browser's local timezone
- Be aware of DST transitions
- Coach's timezone vs. your timezone might cause apparent shifts

### Custom Analysis

The `workouts.json` file is structured for easy analysis:
- Import into Excel or Google Sheets
- Write custom scripts for pattern analysis
- Query specific time periods
- Calculate volume trends

### Integration Possibilities

The data structure supports:
- Export to other calendar apps
- Custom reporting dashboards
- Training load calculations
- Progress tracking visualizations
