## 🔧 **Why Two-Phase Isn't Working Yet:**

The two-phase system is deployed but needs debugging:
- Phase 1 might not be loading the prompt correctly
- Or Mistral might not be following the structure format
- Or there's a JSON validation issue

**I'm fixing this, but for NOW use the workaround above!**
