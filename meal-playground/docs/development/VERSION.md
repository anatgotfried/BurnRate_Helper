# Version History - BurnRate AI Meal Planner

## v1.5.1 - 2025-11-04 (Current) 🎯
**Enhanced AI Prompt Quality**

### Improved Prompt Template
- ✅ **Behavioral rules** - 9 specific rules for AI to follow
- 🔧 **Auto-correction logic** - AI automatically adjusts if totals don't match targets
  - If carbs < target by >5%: add rice, oats, banana, juice
  - If fat > target by >10%: reduce oils, avocado, hummus
  - If protein > target by >20%: reduce protein portions by 10-20%
- 📊 **Validation hook** - AI recalculates totals before returning JSON
- 🎲 **Specific thresholds** - Clear ±2%, ±5%, ±10%, ±20% tolerances
- 📝 **Meal distribution rules** - Requires 7-9 entries with intra/post for every workout
- 🥗 **Digestibility logic** - Explicit pre/intra/post-workout food composition rules
- 🧂 **Sodium enforcement** - Every food must have sodium_mg, auto-add salt if needed
- 🇮🇱 **Localization** - Enhanced Israeli product examples

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed "undefined" appearing in RESEARCH CORPUS section when corpus fails to load
- Added fallback: "Research corpus not available - use general sports nutrition principles"
- Better corpus validation with `corpus && Object.keys(corpus).length > 0` check

### Expected Impact
- Higher accuracy in daily totals matching targets
- Better sodium tracking (fewer warnings)
- More complete meal plans (7-9 entries)
- Better timing around workouts

## v1.5.0 - 2025-11-04 🏥
**MAJOR: Research-Based Calorie Calculations**

### Critical Fixes
- 🔬 **Proper BMR calculation** - Now uses Harris-Benedict equation (gender/age/height-specific)
- 📊 **TDEE methodology** - Calculates Total Daily Energy Expenditure using activity factors
- ⚖️ **Correct deficit application** - Applies 20% deficit to TDEE (not BMR!)
- 🚨 **Safety minimums enforced** - 1,200 kcal for women, 1,500 kcal for men (ADA/AND guidelines)
- ❌ **Removed misleading "workout calories"** - Activity is built into TDEE calculation

### What Changed
**Before (WRONG):**
```
60kg woman, fat loss, 2×60min workouts:
❌ BMR × 0.8 = 1,152 kcal (below minimum!)
❌ "Add back workout calories" = misleading concept
❌ No consideration of activity level
```

**Now (CORRECT):**
```
60kg woman, fat loss, 2×60min workouts:
✅ BMR: 1,380 kcal (Harris-Benedict)
✅ Activity factor: 1.55 (Moderately Active)
✅ TDEE: 2,139 kcal
✅ 20% deficit: 1,711 kcal
✅ Above minimum: Safe!
✅ Adequate carbs: ~336g (fuels training)
```

### Research Citations
- Harris-Benedict equation for BMR (revised)
- Standard activity multipliers (1.2-1.9)
- ADA/AND minimum calorie guidelines
- ACSM 2016 energy balance recommendations

### UI Improvements
- Info modal now shows proper TDEE breakdown
- Displays activity level (Sedentary → Extremely Active)
- Shows deficit applied to TDEE (not BMR)
- Removed confusing "workout calories" display

### Fat Loss Carb Reduction
- Now properly reduces carbs by 30-40% from performance baseline
- Training load 2.4 (high): 8 g/kg → 5.6 g/kg for fat loss
- Maintains adequate workout fuel while creating deficit

---

## v1.4.3 - 2025-11-04
**Fix undefined values in info modal**
- Fixed calorie breakdown not passing through to modal
- Added debug logging for info button clicks

---

## v1.4.2 - 2025-11-04
**Fat Loss Calculation Fix + Info Buttons**
- Fixed fat loss carb calculations (was giving performance-level carbs)
- Added info buttons (ℹ️) to all Daily Summary metrics
- Created beautiful modal with detailed explanations
- New styles-info-modal.css for modal styling

---

## v1.4.1 - 2025-11-04 🔬
**FAST MODE VALIDATION**

### Added
- 🧪 **Test 3: Fast Mode comparison** - Tested 4 models with corpus filtering ON vs OFF
- 📊 **GPT-4o quality evaluation** - Compared filtered vs full corpus outputs
- 📝 **FAST_MODE_COMPARISON.md** - Comprehensive test results and recommendations

### Key Findings
- ✅ Fast Mode works great for Gemini, Mistral, GPT-4o Mini (2x speed, minimal quality loss)
- ⚠️ Claude 3.5 Sonnet needs full corpus (only generated 2/6 meals with Fast Mode)
- 💰 Fast Mode saves ~70% on token costs
- ⚡ Mistral and Claude are 2x faster with Fast Mode

### UI Improvements
- Updated Fast Mode description with test findings
- Added model-specific guidance for Fast Mode
- Removed defunct two-phase generation checkbox

### Documentation
- Created detailed Fast Mode comparison report
- Updated with Claude-specific warnings

## v1.4.0 - 2025-11-03 🎉
**MAJOR: Comprehensive Testing & GPT-4o Evaluation**

### Added
- 🧪 **Test 1: Structure generation** - All 8 models tested on lightweight prompt
- 🧪 **Test 2: Full meal generation** - All 8 models tested on complete prompt
- 🤖 **GPT-4o scoring** - Professional evaluation of all Test 2 results (7 criteria each)
- 📊 **Comprehensive comparison report** - Detailed analysis with recommendations
- 📁 **Organized folder structure** - docs/, testing/, testing/scores/ directories
- 📝 **Three new reports** - MODEL_TEST_REPORT.md, TEST_RESULTS_TABLE.md, COMPARISON_REPORT.md

### Key Findings from Testing
