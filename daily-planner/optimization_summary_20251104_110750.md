## Detailed Results by Iteration

### Iteration 1

**Scores:**
- Overall: 4.5/10
- Tip: 8/10
- Macros: 2/10
- Practical: 6/10
- Timeline: 7/10
- Technical: 3.0/10

**Explanations:**
- Overall: The plan has a good structure and a reasonable approach to fat loss with adequate protein distribution. However, the significant discrepancies in macro and calorie calculations, both within individual meals and in the daily summaries, severely undermine its utility and trustworthiness. The high sodium is also a concern. If the numerical issues were resolved, the plan would be much stronger.
- Tip: The daily tip is well-articulated, actionable, and aligns with the fat loss goal by emphasizing muscle preservation through protein intake. It's motivating and avoids overly technical jargon or citations, making it feel natural.
- Macros: This is the plan's weakest area. There are major inconsistencies: the daily summary calories (1824) do not match the sum of timeline calories (2395), nor do the daily summary carbs (390g) match the timeline sum (350g). Furthermore, the calories calculated from the provided macros for individual meals often do not match the stated calorie count for those meals, and the overall daily macros from the timeline do not add up to the daily summary. This makes the nutritional guidance unreliable.
- Practical: The meal timings are generally logical, with pre/post-workout snacks and regular meals spaced throughout the day. However, the plan includes a 'Pre-Run Snack' at 5:00 AM, followed by a run at 6:00 AM, which is a tight turnaround for digestion, especially for some individuals. The sodium intake is excessively high (4000mg) for a daily plan, which is a practical health concern. The workouts themselves (running and swimming) are reasonable for a 'base' phase and 'moderate' intensity. The plan correctly assigns 0 calories/macros to workouts, but lists sodium and hydration, which is appropriate for intra-workout needs.
- Timeline: The timeline is chronologically sound with a good spread of meals and workouts. The distribution of macros, particularly protein, across multiple meals and around workouts (pre/post) is a strong point for muscle preservation during fat loss. The hydration strategy is also well-distributed throughout the day. The only minor critique is the very early morning snack before a run, which might be too soon for some, but the overall flow is good.

**Improvements Needed:**
- **Resolve all macro and calorie calculation discrepancies:** Ensure that the sum of individual meal macros and calories accurately reflects the daily summary, and that the stated calories for each meal are correctly calculated from its listed macros. This is critical for the plan's credibility.
- **Adjust sodium intake:** The daily sodium target and actual intake (4000mg) are significantly too high for most individuals and should be reduced to a healthier range (e.g., 2300mg or less) unless there's a specific, justified reason for such high intake (e.g., extreme heat, heavy sweating, medical advice).
- **Clarify pre-workout fueling timing:** Consider adjusting the 'Pre-Run Snack' timing to allow for slightly more digestion time before a 60-minute moderate run, or specify the type of snack to be easily digestible (e.g., liquid carbs, simple sugars).

**Technical Issues:**
- Calories don't match macros: 2395 vs 2343
- Summary calories don't match timeline: 1824 vs 2395
- Summary carbs don't match timeline: 390 vs 350
- Entry 0 (05:00): calories don't match macros
- Entry 2 (07:15): calories don't match macros
